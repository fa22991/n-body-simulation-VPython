In this gravitational N-body simulation, I generate the initial positions and velocities of N stars such that they follow the Plummer Sphere model's mass and potential profiles. The total mass contained within a sphere of radius r is given by the formula:

Considering the mass of the entire system/cluster to be 1, I generate a random number from 0-1 to represent the mass contained within some radius r. I then re-arrange the equation to solve for r, where Xi=M(r):
